This repository contains a modified version of the Publii Taste theme, which has been customized to meet specific requirements. The modifications aim to enhance the theme's features and provide additional flexibility for website customization.

## Features

1. **Tab Color Option:** The modified theme introduces a new feature that allows customization of tab colors. Website owners can easily set the colors for browser tabs to align with their branding or design preferences.

2. **Automatic Year in Footer Copyright:** To simplify the process of updating the copyright year, the modified theme includes an automatic year feature. The copyright year will be dynamically updated, eliminating the need for manual year adjustments.

3. **Adjusted Default Navigation Bar Height:** The default navigation bar height has been fine-tuned to optimize space utilization, providing a more compact and streamlined appearance while ensuring smooth navigation.

4. **Included Inter Font:** The modified theme includes the Inter font, which can be used locally for the website without requiring any additional configuration. This addition enhances the visual appeal and typographic choices available to website creators.

5. **Updated Position of Website Updated Date:** The updated date information, previously located in the hero section, has been moved to the footer. This change improves the overall layout and consistency of the theme. Additionally, website owners have the option to disable the display of the website's last updated date if desired.

6. **Reduced Footer Height:** The theme now offers a reduced footer height to optimize spacing, ensuring a more aesthetically pleasing and streamlined layout.

7. **Copy Copyright Text:** Introducing the "Copy Copyright Text" feature, which enables the inclusion of copyright text when content is copied from the website. This ensures proper attribution and adherence to copyright laws.

8. **Added Footer Menu:** Enhancing the theme's functionality, a new footer menu area has been included, providing an additional space for displaying menus and enhancing website navigation.

9. **Styled Forms:** The modified theme also includes styling for forms. To achieve the desired form style, use the custom__form class for forms and form-row class for inputs. Furthermore, a checkbox option named form-agree has been added for forms. This allows website owners to include an agree checkbox for users to agree to terms or conditions before submitting the form.
10. **Citation:** Added a citation option to add citation information in APA, MLA, Chicago and Bluebook format on post.
